#. Translators: The %s will get filled in with the user name
#. of the user, to form a genitive. If this is difficult to
#. translate correctly so that it will work correctly in your
#. language, you may use something equivalent to
#. "Public files of %s", or leave out the %s altogether.
#. In the latter case, please put "%.0s" somewhere in the string,
#. which will match the user name string passed by the C code,
#. but not put the user name in the final string. This is to
#. avoid the warning that msgfmt might otherwise generate.
