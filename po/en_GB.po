#. translate correctly so that it will work correctly in your
#. language, you may use something equivalent to
#. "Public files of %s", or leave out the %s altogether.
#. In the latter case, please put "%.0s" somewhere in the string,
#. which will match the user name string passed by the C code,
#. but not put the user name in the final string. This is to
